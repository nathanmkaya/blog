# Hello, World!

I've always wanted to do this in a formal way. This being starting a blog and having a post about it.
It's not like I have much to say, but I feel it's important to introduce yourself in a formal way.

Hope you will be with me for the long ride as I get to experiment with every technology out there that I can understand.
I promise it will be worth your time plus it will be fun.
